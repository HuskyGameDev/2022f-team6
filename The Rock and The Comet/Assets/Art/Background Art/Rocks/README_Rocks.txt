[General Use]
	[Foreground Rocks] These sprites have a thick black outline around them so that they stand out in the foreground
				 If you want rocks that come off as 'interactive' to the player, use these

	[Background Rocks] These sprites do not have a prominent outline and should be used to decorate the level
				 If you want to make something very rocky looking, but not interactable, use these

The other rocks in this folder are remants from last semester
They have a higher pixel count and are meant to be way larger
Feel free to use them, although I would suggest sticking with the rock spites in the folders for continuity
